Excellent choice. Combining Flutter, Django, PostgreSQL, and Firebase is a powerful and scalable stack. Here is a concrete, step-by-step battle plan to guide you from zero to a completed project.

### Guiding Philosophy: Build the Skeleton First
Focus on establishing the connection between all parts of the system. A simple, end-to-end flow is more valuable than one complex, polished feature. We'll build the Authentication flow first, as it is the gateway to every other feature.

## Phase 1: The Foundation (Weeks 1-2) - "The Handshake"

Goal: A user can download the app, register with their phone number, and have their account created in your Django database. This proves your entire stack is communicating.

### Step 1: Backend First (Django + PostgreSQL)

1.  Set up your Django Project:
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install Django and required packages
    pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers python-dotenv psycopg2-binary

    # Start your project and app
    django-admin startproject boda_backend
    cd boda_backend
    python manage.py startapp riders
    ```

2.  Configure PostgreSQL Database:
    *   Create a new PostgreSQL database (locally or on a cloud provider like AWS RDS or DigitalOcean).
    *   In your `settings.py`, replace the default SQLite config with your PostgreSQL credentials.
    ```python
    # boda_backend/settings.py
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'your_db_name',
            'USER': 'your_db_user',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
            'HOST': 'localhost', # or your cloud DB host
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }
    # Add 'corsheaders' and 'rest_framework' to INSTALLED_APPS
    # Add CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True for now (restrict this later for production!)
    ```

3.  Create the Core Rider Model:
    ```python
    # riders/models.py
    from django.db import models

    class Rider(models.Model):
        PENDING = 'PENDING'
        VERIFIED = 'VERIFIED'
        REJECTED = 'REJECTED'
        STATUS_CHOICES = [
            (PENDING, 'Pending'),
            (VERIFIED, 'Verified'),
            (REJECTED, 'Rejected'),
        ]

        phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=15, unique=True)
        national_id = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True, null=True)
        verification_status = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=STATUS_CHOICES, default=PENDING)
        points = models.IntegerField(default=0)
        created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.phone_number
    ```
    *   Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.

4.  Create a Simple API Endpoint:
    *   Use Django REST Framework to create a simple endpoint to register a rider after Firebase confirms their number.
    ```python
    # riders/views.py
    from rest_framework import status
    from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
    from rest_framework.response import Response
    from .models import Rider

    @api_view(['POST'])
    def register_rider(request):
        phone_number = request.data.get('phoneNumber')
        # Basic validation: Check if the number is provided and doesn't already exist.
        if not phone_number:
            return Response({'error': 'Phone number is required.'}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)

        if Rider.objects.filter(phone_number=phone_number).exists():
            return Response({'error': 'A rider with this number already exists.'}, status=status.HTTP_409_CONFLICT)

        rider = Rider.objects.create(phone_number=phone_number)
        return Response({'message': 'Rider registered successfully!', 'riderId': rider.id}, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
    ```
    *   Configure the URL for this view in `urls.py`.

### Step 2: Mobile Frontend (Flutter + Firebase Auth)

1.  Set up your Flutter Project:
    ```bash
    flutter create boda_learn_app
    cd boda_learn_app
    ```
    *   Add the necessary packages to `pubspec.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        dependencies:
          flutter:
            sdk: flutter
          firebase_core: ^2.24.0
          firebase_auth: ^4.11.0
          http: ^1.1.0
        ```

2.  Configure Firebase Project:
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project and enable Phone Authentication.
    *   Register your Android and iOS apps following Firebase's setup guides. This will give you `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) files to add to your Flutter project.

3.  Build the Registration Screen:
    *   Create a UI with a text field for a phone number and a "Register" button.
    *   Implement the logic:
        1.  User enters phone number.
        2.  Press "Register" -> Trigger Firebase Auth's `verifyPhoneNumber` method. This sends an OTP SMS.
        3.  User enters the OTP.
        4.  Firebase verifies the OTP and returns a Firebase ID Token on success.
        5.  Crucial Step: Send this ID Token to your Django backend (`/api/register`) to create the user record.

### Step 3: Make the Connection

*   Your Flutter app now talks to Firebase for auth.
*   Your Flutter app now talks to your Django backend to create a user.
*   Your Django backend saves the user to PostgreSQL.

Test this entire flow relentlessly. Once a user can register and you see their record in the Django admin panel (`/admin`), you have successfully built the spine of your application.

---

## Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-8)

Now, build upon your solid foundation.

1.  Rider Verification Flow:
    *   Flutter: Create screens for users to upload a photo of their ID and a selfie. Use the `image_picker` package.
    *   Django: Create an API endpoint (`/api/upload-verification`) to receive these images. Store them (e.g., using `django-storages` to save to Firebase Storage or AWS S3). Set the rider's status to `PENDING`.
    *   Admin Dashboard: Create a simple Django Admin view or a separate React admin panel where an admin can see pending riders, view their photos, and approve/reject them.

2.  Lesson & Quiz System:
    *   Django: Create `Lesson` and `Quiz` models. Build API endpoints to list lessons and submit quiz answers.
    *   Flutter: Build the UI to display a list of lessons. Use the `video_player` package to play lesson videos. Build a quiz screen that submits answers to your backend.
    *   Logic: When a quiz is passed, award points to the `Rider` model and mark the lesson as complete.

3.  Raffle System:
    *   Django: Create a `RaffleEntry` model. Your backend logic should automatically create an entry for a rider when they complete a full module or level.
    *   Build an admin endpoint to run the raffle (e.g., select a random winner from the entries).
    *   Flutter: Add a screen where riders can see their raffle entries and if they've won.

4.  Notifications:
    *   Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) in Flutter to receive push notifications for winner announcements and new lesson alerts.

## Phase 3: Polish & Launch (Weeks 9-12)

1.  Testing: Thoroughly test all flows on both Android and iOS devices.
2.  UI/UX Polish: Refine the design based on feedback.
3.  Deployment:
    *   Backend: Deploy Django to a platform like Heroku, DigitalOcean App Platform, or an AWS EC2 instance.
    *   Database: Use a cloud-managed PostgreSQL database (e.g., AWS RDS, DigitalOcean Managed Databases).
    *   Mobile App: Build release versions and publish to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
4.  Security Hardening: Remove temporary CORS settings, add proper environment variables for secrets, and ensure your API endpoints are protected.

### Your Immediate Next Action:

Start with Phase 1, Step 1. Set up that Django project and database. The satisfaction of seeing that first rider record created in your own database via your own API is the fuel that will power the rest of your development journey. Good luck
